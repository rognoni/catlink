# 🐱🔗 catlink – Categorized Links, for methodical people.
If you want spend less time and less mental energy every day, we are creating a simple but powerful web tool to archive, search and share useful information with your small community of smart people.

## Architecture
This project is based on:

- [Laravel on AlterVista](https://github.com/rognoni/laravista)
- the update to **Laravel 10** of the previous project, see the italian [comments here](https://web.archive.org/web/20230719210752/https://forum.it.altervista.org/php-mysql-e-apache-htaccess/293642-laravel-altervista.html)

## Category VS Tag
If you see [the way normally used](https://pinboard.in/recent/) to tag links, it is really too confusing for me: casual words in casual order.

A hierarchical categories system is much clearer and allow you to search starting from the generic (on the left) to the details (on the right), for example:
```
/🇺🇸us/New York/jobs/programmer
```

or vegan restaurants at Milan city:
```
/🇮🇹it/Milano/ristoranti/vegani
```
